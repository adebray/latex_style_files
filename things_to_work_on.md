#### Lecture notes
 - My class files are currently incompatible with the `\VerbatimFootnotes` command from the `fancyvrb`
   package. This is something I wanted to use once or twice, so I would like to isolate the bug and
   fix it. (Specifically, after the `\VerbatimFootnotes` command is called, all footnote links do not
   work.)

#### Problem Sets
 - I still need to set up `enumitem` properly.

#### Other
 - Once I factor everything out properly, I will have to unify my macros for problem sets and notes.
