Today and the next few lectures, we're going to have a change of pace, developing some more fundamental properties
of schemes before using them to talk more about quasicoherent sheaves, differentials, etc. Today, for example,
we'll talk about affine covers, and what properties can be checked affine-locally. This will enable us to turn our
story about differentials from one about rings and modules to one about schemes and quasicoherent sheaves.
\begin{defn}
An \term{affine open} of a scheme \(X\) is an open subset \(U\) that is isomorphic to \(\Spec A\) for some ring
\(A\).
\end{defn}
The intersection of affine opens may not be itself open. For example, let \(X = \A^2\amalg_{\A^2\setminus 0}\A^2\),
the \term{plane with two opens} (we've already done this with a line, and this isn't very different). The
intersection of the two copies of \(\A^2\), which are both affine opens, is \(\A^2\setminus 0\), which we know is
not affine.

One can define what it means for a scheme to be separated, which is analogous to the Hausdorff condition on
manifolds, and will guarantee that the intersection of affine opens is affine.
\begin{prop}
\label{affineintersprop}
Let \(X\) be a scheme and \(\Spec A,\Spec B\subset X\) be affine opens. Then, \(\Spec A\cap\Spec B\) is a union of
open subsets that are distinguished open subsets for both \(\Spec A\) and \(\Spec B\).
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
Suppose \(p\in\Spec A\cap\Spec B\). Then, there's an \(f\in A\) such that \(p\in\Spec A_f\subset\Spec A\cap\Spec
B\), and therefore a \(g\in B\) such that \(p\in\Spec B_g\subset\Spec A_f\subset\Spec A\cap\Spec B\).

The claim is that \(\Spec B_g\) is a distinguished open in \(\Spec A\). Restriction defines a map \(B = \sO_X(\Spec
B)\to\sO_X(\Spec A_f) = A_f\); let \(\widetilde g\) be the image of \(g\) under this map. Then, the points of
\(\Spec A_f\) where \(g\) vanishes are the same as the same points where \(\widetilde g\) vanishes (which is
exactly what restriction does). Thus, \(\Spec B_g = \Spec (A_f)_{\widetilde g} = \Spec A_{f\widetilde g}\).
\end{proof}
One way to think of this is that a distinguished open of a distinguished open is distinguished in the original
scheme.

We'll use this to prove an extremely useful lemma, the affine communication lemma. This is sometimes called the ACL
(not to be confused with the Austin City Limits music festival nor the anterior cruciate ligament in your knee,
though these are both great things too).
\begin{lem}[Affine communication lemma]
\label{ACL}
Suppose \(P\) is a property\footnote{Formally, a \term{property} is a subset of the set of affine opens of \(X\);
more generally, one could do this in a way independent of the scheme \(X\) by considering the set of all affine
open embeddings \(\Spec A\inj X\) over all schemes \(X\); a general property is a subset of this huge set. Examples
will be Noetherianness, reducedness, etc.}
enjoyed by some affine opens of a scheme \(X\), such that:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item\label{resthyp} The property is preserved by restriction: if \(\Spec A\in P\), then for all \(f\in A\),
	\(\Spec A_f\in P\).
	\item\label{gluehyp} The property is preserved by finite gluing: if \(A = (f_1,\dotsc,f_n)\) and \(\Spec
	A_{f_i}\in P\) for all \(i\), then \(\Spec A\in P\).
	\item\label{coverhyp} There is a cover of \(X\) by affine opens that satisfy \(P\).
\end{enumerate}
Then, every affine open subset of \(X\) is in \(P\).
\end{lem}
\begin{defn}
If \(P\) is a property of affine opens that satisfies the hypotheses of Lemma~\ref{ACL}, then we'll call \(P\) an
\term{affine-local} property.
\end{defn}
We'll generally use this to prove things about a scheme using only a particular cover, rather than having to check
all affine opens. Another nice fact about affine-local properties is that any open subset \(U\subset X\) (not just
affine opens) inherits any affine-local property of \(X\). Many of these properties will ultimately be geometric,
and we'll give a long list of them.
\begin{proof}[Proof of Lemma~\ref{ACL}]
The proof is actually trivial: the perfect lemma is non-obvious, extremely useful, and easy to prove.

Suppose \(\Spec A\subset X\) is open. There's a cover \(\fU\) of \(X\) by affine opens \(\Spec B_i\in P\) by
hypothesis \eqref{coverhyp}. By Proposition~\ref{affineintersprop}, \(\Spec B_i\cap\Spec A\) can be covered by open
subsets which are distinguished opens of both \(\Spec A\) and \(X\), and by hypothesis~\eqref{resthyp}, each of
these has property \(P\). Thus, there's a cover of \(\Spec A\) by distinguished opens \(\Spec A_f\in P\).
Since \(\Spec A\) is quasicompact, then we may assume this cover is finite, so by hypothesis~\eqref{gluehyp},
\(\Spec A\in P\).
\end{proof}
There's a lot of verifications that various properties are affine-local; we'll skip over some of these.

The following proposition is Exercises 5.3.G and 5.3.H in Vakil's notes. Recall that a ring is reduced if it has no
nilpotents other than \(0\).
\begin{prop}
Let \(A\) be a ring and \(f_1,\dotsc,f_n\) generate \(A\).
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \(A\) is reduced iff \(A_{f_i}\) is reduced for all \(i\).
	\item\label{noethaffloc} \(A\) is Noetherian iff \(A_{f_i}\) is Noetherian for all \(i\).
	\item\label{fgloc} If \(B\) is another ring and \(B\to A\) gives \(A\) the structure of a \(B\)-algebra, then
	\(A\) is finitely generated over \(B\) iff each \(A_{f_i}\) is finitely generated over \(B\).
\end{enumerate}
\end{prop}
This means that the analogoues of these properties for schemes are affine-local.
\begin{proof}[Proof of items~\eqref{noethaffloc} and \eqref{fgloc}]
Though we'll only prove one of these, most of the proofs of these things go the same way. There are a few
exceptions, however.

First, suppose \(A\) is Noetherian, and let \(I_1\subsetneqq I_2\subsetneqq I_3\subsetneqq\dotsb\) be an ascending
chain of ideals in \(A_f\). Let \(\iota:A\inj A_f\) be the canonical inclusion, and let \(J_i =
\iota^{-1}(I_i)\).\footnote{If \(A\) is an integral domain, we can think of this as \(I_i\cap A\subset A\subset A_f\),
but this isn't always true in general.} Then, \(J_1\subset J_2\subset J_3\subset\dotsb\). Inside \(A_f\), there
must be some \(x/f^N\in I_{n+1}\ I_n\), and therefore, by clearing denominators, \(x\in J_{n+1}\setminus J_n\), so
\(A\) isn't Noetherian.

In the other direction, we'll also prove the contrapositive. Suppose \(J_1\subsetneqq J_2\subsetneqq
J_3\subsetneqq\dotsb\) be an ascending chain of ideals in \(A\), and for each \(i\), let \(I_{i,j}\) be the
localization of \(J_j\) at \(f_i\). Then, for all \(j\), there's some \(i\) for which \(I_{i,j}\subsetneqq
I_{i,j+1}\). The idea is that since the \(f_i\) generate \(A\), then \(A\inj\prod_{i=1}^n A_{f_i}\) sending
\(r_i\mapsto (r_i)_{i=1}^n\). If \(r_j\in J_{j+1}\setminus J_j\), then \(r_j\subset I_{i,j}\) for al \(i\), but it
can't be in all of the \(I_{i,j+1}\). There's a little more to say here, but it's kind of annoying.

For~\eqref{fgloc} let \(r_1,\dotsc,r_n\) be generators of \(A\) as a \(B\)-algebra. Then, \(A_f\) is generated by
\(\set{r_1,\dotsc,r_n,1/f}\), so it's clearly finitely generated. Conversely, since the \(f_i\) generate \(A\),
then \(1 = \sum r_if_i\) for some \(r_i\in A\). If \(A_{f_i}\) is generated by a finite set
\(\set{s_{ij}/f_j^{k_j}}\), with the \(s_{ij}\in A\), then (again, there's something to check here) \(A\) is
generated by \(\set{f_i, r_i, s_{ij}}\), which is a finite set.
\end{proof}
\begin{defn}
A scheme \(X\) is \term{reduced} if for all open subsets \(U\subset X\), \(\sO_X(U)\) is a reduced ring.
\end{defn}
Since \(\sO_X(U)\inj\prod_{x\in U}\sO_{X,x}\) as rings, this is equivalent to \(\sO_{X,x}\) being reduced for all
\(x\in X\).

One could also define an affine scheme \(\Spec A\) to be reduced if \(A\) is a reduced ring; then, our definition
is equivalent to affine opens of \(X\) being reduced, and hence, by Lemma~\ref{ACL}, there's a cover of \(X\) by
reduced affine opens. That is, we've proven the following.
\begin{cor}
The following are equivalent for a scheme \(X\).
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \(X\) is reduced.
	\item For every \(x\in X\), \(\sO_{X,x}\) is reduced as a ring.
	\item All affine opens of \(X\) are reduced.
	\item There exists a cover of \(X\) by reduced affine opens.
\end{enumerate}
\end{cor}
The na√Øve definition of reducedness would be for \(\Gamma(\sO_X)\) to be a reduced ring; however, this is
\emph{not} equivalent. One example is the ``first-order neighborhood of \(\P^1\)'' in the total space \(\sO(1)\).
Using split square-zero extensions, \(\sO_{\P^1}\oplus\sO(-1)\) is a ring, so we can define the scheme
\(X = \Spec(\sO_{\P^1}\oplus\sO(-1))\). This has no nonconstant global functions, so \(\Gamma(\sO_X)\) is reduced;
however, locally, the functions on the first-order neighborhood looks like \(k[\e]/(\e^2)\), which is not reduced.
This is why we used the definition that we did.

One moral is that, on non-affine schemes, global ring-theoretic properties may be badly behaved, so it's better to
use local ones.
\begin{defn}
Let \(X\) be a scheme.
\begin{itemize}
	\item \(X\) is \term{locally Noetherian} if there's a cover \(\fU\) by affine opens \(X = \bigcup_{i\in I}
	\Spec A_i\) such that each \(A_i\) is a Noetherian ring.
	\item \(X\) is \term{Noetherian} if it's quasicompact and locally Noetherian.
\end{itemize}
\end{defn}
Hence, if \(X\) is Noetherian, we can choose the cover \(\fU\) to be finite. Moreover, by Lemma~\ref{ACL}, if \(X\)
is locally Noetherian, \emph{all} affine open subsets of \(X\) are Noetherian.

Noetherianness is a very nice property, which is good because lots of schemes you and I might care about are
Noetherian. It's a strong ``finite-dimensionality'' condition. The following property is one nice example.
\begin{prop}
\label{noethnice}
If \(X\) is a Noetherian scheme, it's also Noetherian as a topological space, and therefore all open subsets of
\(X\) are quasicompact.
\end{prop}
Hence, for Noetherian schemes, the quasicompactness propagates, which is nice.
\begin{defn}
A scheme \(X\) is \term{quasiseparated} (abbreviated QS) if the intersection of any two quasicompact opens of \(X\)
is itself quasicompact.
\end{defn}
This means that the intersection of two affines may not be affine, but is a finite union of affines. This is not
just nice, but something that's scary to not have. Affine schemes are clearly QS, but so are locally Noetherian
schemes, because all quasicompact open subsets \(U\) of a locally Noetherian scheme \(X\) are Noetherian, so by
Proposition~\ref{noethnice}, any open subset of \(U\) is also quasicompact.

The QS condition is not a restriction, because almost all schemes you will come across will be quasiseparated;
instead, it's a signal that QS is used in a proof.
\begin{exm}
There are schemes that are not quasiseparated, however; if \(\A_k^\infty = \Spec k[x_1,x_2,\dotsc]\), then
\(\A_k^\infty\setminus 0\) isn't quasiseparated (not quasicompact).
\end{exm}
In some literature, ``scheme'' means ``quasicompact, quasiseparated scheme,'' and a scheme lacking these hypotheses
is explicity noted to not satisfy them. There is a lot of interesting infinite-dimensional geometry (e.g.\
classifying vector bundles), but we're not going to worry about them in this class.

We'll use the acronym QCQS to denote ``quasicompact quasiseparated;'' a scheme \(X\) is QCQS iff there's a finite
cover of \(X\) by affine opens, all of whose pairwise intersections are finite unions of affines. This is an
extremely useful hypothesis in arguments where you want to glue a hypothesis that we know about affine opens of a
QCQS scheme. It's not a particularly interesting geometric property, but is a ``reasonableness'' property, akin to
paracompactness of manifolds, that is a technical ingredient in proofs.
\subsection*{Properties of morphisms.}
Let \(\pi:X\to Y\) be a map of schemes. The preceding discussion allows us to define lots of different nice
properties that \(\pi\) could satisfy. In particular, we'll define a bunch of properties of \(\pi\) that can be
determined affine-locally on both \(X\) and \(Y\) (since here they correspond to homomorphisms of rings in the
opposite direction).

To be precise, let \(\Spec B\subset Y\) be an affine open and \(\Spec A\subset\pi^{-1}(\Spec B)\), so \(\Spec A\)
is an affine open subset of \(X\). Thus, \(A\) is a \(B\)-algebra.
\begin{defn}
\(\pi\) is \term{locally of finite type} if for every affine open \(\Spec B\subset Y\) and every affine open
\(\Spec A\subset\pi^{-1}(\Spec B)\), \(A\) is finitely generated as a \(B\)-algebra.
\end{defn}
If \(X\) and \(Y\) are Noetherian, this is equivalent to such \(A\) being finitely presented as a \(B\)-algebra; in
general, the two may be different, and if \(A\) is finitely presented as a \(B\)-algebra, one says \(\pi\) is
\term{locally of finite presentation}. We're not going to use this very much.

By the affine communication lemma, \(\pi\) is locally of finite type iff for all affine opens \(\Spec B\) of \(Y\),
\(\pi^{-1}(\Spec B)\) can be covered by affine opens \(\Spec A_i\) such that \(A_i\) is a finitely generated
\(B\)-algebra, which is easier to check.

Now, we can generalize a few properties of schemes to properties of morphisms.
\begin{comp}{defn}{itemize}
	\item \(\pi\) is \term{quasicompact} (resp.\ \term{quasiseparated}) if for all affine opens \(\Spec B\subset
	Y\), \(\pi^{-1}(\Spec B)\) is quasicompact (resp.\ quasiseparated).
	\item \(\pi\) is \term{affine} if for all affine opens \(\Spec B\subset Y\), \(\pi^{-1}(\Spec B)\) is affine.
\end{comp}
We'll prove these satisfy the hypotheses of Lemma~\ref{ACL}; this will make them extremely useful.
