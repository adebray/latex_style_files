% The personal style choices I make for my lecture notes
% One tantalizing idea is to make multiple style files representing several different
% styles (e.g. I would prefer to use a different style for lecture notes and other
% notes that I write).

% Current issues:
%   1. This currently only supports article-based lecture notes (base class is amsart, and
%      much of the title page formatting depends on that rather than amsbook). Someday, I
%      would like to have both options.
%   2. I still can't get fancyhdr to work the way I want it to.

\RequirePackage{fancyhdr}
\RequirePackage{titlesec}
\RequirePackage{xcolor}
\RequirePackage[dotinlabels]{titletoc}
% after the font has been chosen
\AtBeginDocument{
	\usepackage{microtype}
}

% Set colors for hyperref
\hypersetup{
	colorlinks,
	linkcolor={red!50!black},
	citecolor={green!50!black},
	urlcolor={blue!80!black}
}

% Custom section titles
% I really want to not depend on titlesec, as it's frustrating to use. However,
% this setup is stable.
\titleformat{\section}[frame]
  {\normalfont}
  {\filright
   \footnotesize
   \enspace Lecture \Roman{section}.\enspace}
  {8pt}
  {\Large\bfseries\filcenter}
\titlecontents{section}[1.5em]{}{\contentslabel{2.3em}}{\hspace*{-2.3em}}{\hfill\contentspage}

% Ornament to divide different parts of a section without introducing a new subsection
\newcommand{\orbreak}{
\begin{center}
	\adforn{17}\;\(\cdot\)\;\adforn{18}
	\vspace{0.2cm}
