% TeX class files aren't usually split into several subfiles, so input and
% include aren't relative to the current file path. Thus, I need to look
% up the full path of the current file to include other .tex files in this
% directory.
% You will have to change this on your system to get this to work (and yes, I
% know this is a temporary and inelegant solution).

% I found myself making the same few changes when using minnotes_d, so I created
% this class, which applies all of my macros (functionality) changes, and a very few
% style changes.

% Provides a way to check whether this class is being used

% Other options can be handed off to the amsart class (e.g. fontsize)
% I want to double-check that I am doing option-passing correctly.
