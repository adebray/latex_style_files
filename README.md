This repo holds a LaTeX `.cls` file, `pset_d.cls`, that defines a document class for problem sets.
It came about because I realized that I do a lot of the same things in each class for problem sets,
and it would be good to centralize that. Moreover, there are a few things that I have been meaning
to fix about my problem set template, and this gives me the opportunity to do that.

I'll document the class options here too, but there won't be too many.
