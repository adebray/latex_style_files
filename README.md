This repo holds a LaTeX `.cls` file, `pset_d.cls`, that defines a document class for problem sets.
It came about because I realized that I do a lot of the same things in each class for problem sets,
and it would be good to centralize that. Moreover, there are a few things that I have been meaning
to fix about my problem set template, and this gives me the opportunity to do that.

I will also document the class options here, and how to use the class (there will also be some
examples).

### Current Status

I've ported my existing code for problem sets into this `.cls` file, but I still need to add a few
features (most notably, I want to tweak the `enumerate` environment to fix a few things that made my
documents less readable; these improvements are the major reason I decided to write this).

I also need to test this code; I'm sure there are things I did wrong, but I haven't tried them yet.

There are also various smaller TODOs scattered throughout my document.

Finally, I would like to provide some examples: some minimal examples of how to use the class, and some
richer examples of what problem sets look like in this template, including demonstrating various class
options.
