# goal: things that I might want to implement later can be written here

- variants on = signs, e.g.
	* =:
	* \overset{?}{=}
	* ``='' (inside \text)
- a tensor product that behaves like \int\limits
	* (or just do this in display mode automatically)
- short exact sequence of groups (so 1 instead of 0)
- fix QCoh (mathsf), add Coh
- things I use often enough to add:
	* Det
	* Ad
	* Cl
	* tikzpt and other tikz shortcuts?
	* \mathfrak t
	* \modmod
- allow the ability to define a bunch of mathcal, etc. letters quickly, e.g. via one command.
	* possibly also "turn on all mathcal letters"
